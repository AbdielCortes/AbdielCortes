### Hello there and welcome to my GitHub profile

My name is Abdiel Cortés (he/him) and I’m a software engineering student at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. I'm in love with coding and one day I want to be able to create things that make a positive impact on the world. The programming language that I’m most familiar with is Java, but I’m also quite experienced with python and C++. 
I'm looking for an internship that allows me to apply what I've learned, but also allows me to grow my skills as a software developer. My interests include but are not limited to: software development, video game design, machine learning, cryptography, outer space, and many more.
To know more about me you can visit my [portfolio](https://abdielcortes.wixsite.com/portfolio) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdiel-cortes/). Additionally, you can email me at abdiel.cortes@upr.edu.
